<div>
	This Component was made to make it possible to create a menu item that has only modules and no component.<br />
	You can use it by adding a new menu item, select "Blank Component" from the "Menu Item Type" list, and save.<br />
	then, go to the module manager, and assign the modules you want to use with this menu item, and you're done!<br />
