# com_blank - Blank Component
> This Joomla Component was made to make it possible to create a menu item that has only modules and no component.
	You can use it by adding a new menu item, select "Blank Component" from the "Menu Item Type" list, and save.
	then, go to the module manager, and assign the modules you want to use with this menu item, and you're done!
